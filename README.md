# California Wildfire Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains the code for my project Exploratory Data analysis of California Wildfires. The project code is included in the notebook [calfire_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/ananya-sampat/ca-wildfires/blob/main/calfire_analysis.ipynb) and uses a variety of data science techniques including data cleaning, data preprocessing, synthetic data generation and data visualization techniques.

## Data

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) maintains historical data about wildfires in California. This is a summary dataset that is hosted by Cornell University Center for Advance Computing - https://www.cac.cornell.edu/

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites packages needed are included in the `environment.yml` file and at starting of main notebook.

## Analysis Summary

- The number of wild fire incidents have increased significantly over the recent years. This translates to both the duration and the acres destroyed by the fire.
- Outside lightning, most of the major causes of wildfires are man made and hence preventable.
- The fact that fire sizes and durations cluster around the agencies that are responsible for fire management seem to suggest that some agencies have better practices than others when it comes to containment of wildfires.
